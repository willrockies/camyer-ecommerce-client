### Angular introduction
 - adding components 
 - Http client module
 - Observables
 - Typescript

 # Goal

 to be able to use the http client to retrieve data from the API

 to understand the basics of observables and typescript

## Intro to the http client module


## Observables
 - A sequence of items that arrive asynchronously over time
# HTTP, Observables and RXJS
 1. HTTP Get Request from shopService
 2. Receive the observable and cast it into a products array
 3. Subscribe to the Observable from the component 
 4. Assign the products array to a local variable for use in the components template

# RXJS
 - Reactive extensions for javascript
 - Utility library for working with the observables, similiar to loadsh or underscore for javascript objects and arrays
 - Uses the pipe() method to chain Rxjs operators together
